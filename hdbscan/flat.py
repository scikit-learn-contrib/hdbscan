"""flat.py

Provides alternative functions to hdbscan.HDBSCAN and others to
1. Allow prediction on a flat clustering by specifying 'n_clusters'.
    This is done by choosing the best cluster_selection_epsilon that produces
    the required number of clusters without adding unnecessary outliers.
2. Makes approximate_predict, membership_vector, and
    all_points_membership_vectors consistent with cluster_selection_epsilon

Provides the following functions:
==================================
HDBSCAN_flat: trained HDBSCAN instance with 'n_clusters' clusters
    The attributes (labels, probabilities, prediction_data) are tuned to
    produce 'n_clusters' clusters.

approximate_predict_flat: labels and probabilities for novel points
    Allows selecting n_clusters for novel points, or using the
    original clustering (potentially specified using cluster_selection_epsilon)

membership_vector_flat: Soft-clustering probabilities for novel points
    Similar to approximate_predict_flat, but for soft-clustering.
    **Use with caution**

all_points_membership_vectors_flat: Soft-clustering probabilities
    Similar to membership_vector_flat, but for points in training set
    **Use with caution**

    Parameters
    ----------
    clusterer : HDBSCAN
        A clustering object that has been fit to the data and
        either had ``prediction_data=True`` set, or called the
        ``generate_prediction_data`` method after the fact.

    points_to_predict : array, or array-like (n_samples, n_features)
        The new data points to predict cluster labels for. They should
        have the same dimensionality as the original dataset over which
        clusterer was fit.

    n_clusters: int, default=None
        The number of clusters to have in the flat clustering
            (over the training data, not points_to_predict)
        Ignored when prediction_data is supplied.

    cluster_selection_epsilon: float, default=None
        core-distance below which to stop splitting clusters.

        This argument is ignored if n_clusters is supplied.

    prediction_data: PredictionData, default=None
        If supplied, use this to predict clusters for points_to_predict.
        This allows predicting on multiple datasets without corrupting
            prediction data associated with clusterer.

        If neither n_clusters, nor prediction_data are supplied,
            then the prediction_data associated with clusterer is used.

    return_prediction_data: bool, default=False
        If True, return prediction_data along with labels and proba.

    Returns
    -------
    labels : array (n_samples,)
        The predicted labels of the ``points_to_predict``

    probabilities : array (n_samples,)
        The soft cluster scores for each of the ``points_to_predict``

    (Adaptation of hdbscan's all_points_membership_vector

    Predict soft cluster membership vectors for all points in the
    original dataset the clusterer was trained on. This function is more
    efficient by making use of the fact that all points are already in the
    condensed tree, and processing in bulk.

    Parameters
    ----------
    clusterer : HDBSCAN
         A clustering object that has been fit to the data and
        either had ``prediction_data=True`` set, or called the
        ``generate_prediction_data`` method after the fact.
        This method does not work if the clusterer was trained
        with ``metric='precomputed'``.

    prediction_data: PredictionData, default=None
        Prediction data associated with HDBSCAN for some flat clustering

    n_clusters: int, optional, default=None
        Number of clusters over which to compute membership probabilities.
        These clusters are obtained as a flat clustering at some
            cluster_selection_epsilon.

    cluster_selection_epsilon: float, optional, default=None
        core-distance below which to stop splitting clusters.
        This can indirectly impose n_clusters.
        This argument is ignored if n_clusters is supplied.

    Note: If neither n_clusters nor cluster_selection_epsilon are supplied,
        the clusterer's original clustering is used.

    Returns
    -------
    membership_vectors : array (n_samples, n_clusters)
        The probability that point ``i`` of the original dataset is a member of
        cluster ``j`` is in ``membership_vectors[i, j]``.
